- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wwsu99
- Iâ€™m just uploading SQL code here for now. 
- Currently learning python to perform web scraping to get more data to play with instead of using Kaggle.  Also want to learn visualization using Python since Excel is getting slower.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects posted here. I would love to work with others on an anime recommendation database, then transforming it into a website or application.
- You can reach me by my e-mail at wesleysu0799@gmail.com.
